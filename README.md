CUL Upcoming Events block
=========================
The block displays the displays future events in a summarized list. The number of days in advance is determined 
by the calendar_lookahead setting in Site Administration > Appearance > Calendar. This can be overridden by a setting 
in Preference on the user page when logged in. 

Events are generated directly from the calendar and/or activity deadlines, providing a link to full details or 
directly to the activity.

There are also links to Go to calendar... and add a New Event....
